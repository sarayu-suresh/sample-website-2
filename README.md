# sample-website-2
This is a responsive sample website designed for learning purpose. It has 4 sections and they are:
- ### Navigation Bar :
      Made using the bootstrapâ€™s navigation header.
- ### Section 1:
      This is divided into two:
       1. A jumbotron section. ( A lightweight, flexible component that can optionally extend the entire viewport to showcase key marketing messages on your site ). In this I have used jumbotron  with full width and without rounded corners.
       2. A carousel section. ( The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript. It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators ). In this I have used carousel with controls.
- ### Section 2:
       With nested rows and columns of images and text. Made use of grid system effectively. At the bottom there is button with modals popping up. ( It is used to add dialogs to site for lightboxes, user notifications, or completely custom content)
- ### Section 3:
      Consists of 3 images in 3 cols and button below each with different modals. In each modal the content is a YouTube video embeded using iframe.
- ### Section 4:
      Footer:
      Divided into two:
      1. A logo
      2. Social icons made using font awesome icons.( by directly linking the site in the head )
